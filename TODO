# TODO
Shapes: 
   Fix circle pixels overdraw. Can be done by using additional buffer for xS that counts minimally used X for specific line.
Font: 
   Implement string reading/iterating function with support of &rtl; and &ltr; sequences. Can be done by implementing a string iterator with a buffer saving unicode characters when direction inversion sequence is met, unti the closing direction sequence.
Easy abstraction:
   Special widget made exactly for quick and simple abstractions without need to register additional class
