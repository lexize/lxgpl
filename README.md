**LXGPL** is **L**exize's **G**eneral **P**urpose **L**ibrary, a library containing stuff i often need in my projects, mostly related to graphics, ui, and math.
There are some components such as:
* Colors related math.
* Dynamic Arrays.
* HashMaps.
* UI library scratch (will work on it eventually).
* Canvas with multiple pixel modes, such as:
    * (A)RGB/BGR
    * RGB/BGR(A)
    * Grayscale.
    * Mono (1 bit per pixel).
* Software shapes renderer, which contains, rectangles, lines, circles, and also triangles.
* Vectors of various types, such as Vec2I/L/F/D, and functions for working with them.
A lot of math in the library is based on fixed point math, which is a way to represent numbers with fractional part by using specific amount of bits (in library it is often 8 or 16 bits).\
Do not expect good documentation for a while. Even tho i am trying to document most of the stuff, i am mostly focused on writing code. Do expect documentation to be a thing eventually, unless i abandon the project.
